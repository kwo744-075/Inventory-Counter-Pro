This involves modifying the relevant files.\n2.  **Home Screen Modifications:** I will remove the modalDemos array from the app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx file.\n\nAfter I implement these changes, you'll have a modified version of your app that reflects the new name and has the modal demos removed.\n\nI will now instruct the coding agent to implement the plan.
